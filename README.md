# How are Citi Bikes being used in NYC?

 ### **Overview**
Citi Bike is the largest bike sharing programme in the United States.  This project utilised [data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) covering a four month period, December 2022 to March 2023, to understand how Citi Bikes were being used, who was riding them, when and where.

### **Tableau dashboard and story**
Tableau was utilised for the data visualisation.  
Several dashboards were developed, along with a story.
